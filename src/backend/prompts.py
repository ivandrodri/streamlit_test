SIMPLE_PROMPT_SMALL_MODELS = """
Instructions: You are analyzing a mosaic plot made up of sequential video frames from a carâ€™s camera. The camera is mounted on the car, providing a view of the surroundings. Your task is to determine if there is a potential hazard related to theft or robbery based on the visual information in these frames.

Steps:
1. Examine each frame in the mosaic plot from top-left to bottom-right.
2. Look for specific signs of theft or robbery, such as:
   - Individuals reaching into the car.
   - Suspicious behavior like loitering near the car with apparent intent.
   - Individuals with weapons or wearing masks approaching the car.
   - Aggressive or threatening actions directed towards the camera.

Output Format (JSON):
{{
    "hazard_detected": true/false,
    "hazard_type": "none" or ["theft", "robbery"],
    "reasoning": "A clear, concise sentence explaining why"
}}

Important Notes:
- Only report hazards that directly threaten the car or the camera's field of view.
- Ignore normal pedestrian activity and actions related to other cars.
- Be conservative in your assessment. Report no hazard if the situation is unclear or normal.
